Codes for Kaggle 30 days of ML 2021
First, two classification models (XGB and RF) are trained and tuned to answer the high-low target value classification.
Within each of the 4 possible combinations of (XGB,RF) answers, (high,high), (low,low), (high,low), (low,high) a XGBRegressor model was trained and tunned.
Thus, an stack-guided ML model was trained and runned on test. In addition the model as combined with existing models within our team
